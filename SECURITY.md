## Supported versions

ciphereditor is supported on a best endeavours basis. Patches will be applied to the latest version rather than retroactively to older versions. To ensure you are using the most secure version, use the [latest release](https://github.com/wierkstudio/ciphereditor/releases/latest). The official [live version](https://ciphereditor.com/) is always up to date.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you found any issues that might have security implications, please send a report to security@wierk.lu. This will help to assess the risk and start the necessary steps.
